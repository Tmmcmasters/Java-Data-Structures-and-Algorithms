# Java Algorithms & Data Structures

I have done personal self study in pursuit of learning more about complex topics. In this repo, I have followed along a book (below) that explains complex topics with Algorithms and Data Structures. This is personal self study as well as a general representation of my knowledge. You will also find examples of OOP. 

## ISSUE:

After beginning a data strucutures and algorithms book, I learned that there were missing components of the book and I am going to find a new one. These missing components were continuesly mentioned throughout each chapter. Unfortunately, I believe I am going to have to scrap it. For now, I will create a new branch for each book I try.
